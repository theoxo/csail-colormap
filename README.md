# What
An opinionated colormap for [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), based on the [MIT CSAIL Brand Guidelines](https://www.csail.mit.edu/logo_asset_suite).
Note: obviously in no way oficially affiliated with CSAIL. Just a selection of colors for your plots based off my personal preferences.
# Why
Why not?
# Installation
1. Download [csail.mplstyle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theoxo/csail-colormap/main/csail.mplstyle)
2. Put it in `<PATH TO YOUR MATPLOTLIB INSTALLATION>/mpl-data/stylelib`. Note: If you use a package manager such as conda, you may want to make sure that you are putting the file in the matplotlib installation used by the environment you want to use the colormap with.
3. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.style.use('csail')`
4. Done!
